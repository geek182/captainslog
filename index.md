# Captain's log 
First entry or 21092021 :)

## Background information or Why?
The captain's log was a form of log entry record-keeping that was used since the first captains sailed Earth's seas in ancient history. The log was used to inform the captain's superiors of what was happening on a mission and to record historical facts for future generations

Keep the record of the some problems that I have faced until now, sometimes with a nice solution (give me a break :D)
